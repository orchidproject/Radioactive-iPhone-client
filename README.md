About MapAttack
===============

http://mapattack.org

MapAttack is a game of real-time strategy built for real life. Virtual geofences 
are scattered onto the map and players must physically go to where they are on the 
map in order to capture them. The winner is the team that captures the most points.

The game is powered by the Geoloqi platform (https://geoloqi.com) and interacts with
its REST and Streaming APIs. See https://developers.geoloqi.com for more information.

You will also need to run a game server which you can find here: https://github.com/geoloqi/MapAttack
